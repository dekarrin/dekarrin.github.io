	<p>
		Hello, there! I'm a software engineer and anime enthusiast. This is my
		personal website, where I give a little bit of info about myself and my
		projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		My full resum√© of professional activities can be found online on my
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-nelson-973a64144/">LinkedIn
		Page</a>; this page is mainly filled up with info about me, as well as a
		few projects I've chosen to highlight. If you need to reach out to me for
		any reason, please feel free to do so via any of my profiles that I maintain
		on social media. I'll typically respond fairly quickly, and I'm a lot more
		likely to reply there than I am through email.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="http://patchouli.dekarrin.com">Patchouli Article Library</a> is
		where I publish any articles I write as the mood strikes me. I'd hesitate to
		call it a blog, as I post pretty infrequently, but it's something along those
		lines.
	</p>

		<h2>Profiles</h2>
		<p>
			I have a variety of profiles online. Most of them are under my personal
			user ID 'dekarrin'; most all of the dekarrins you see online are me!
			However, there are a few cases where someone has managed to grab the name
			before I've had a chance. That's okay, though! All is fair in love, war,
			death, taxes, and of course, reservation of online names.
		</p>
		<p>Here is a probably-incomplete list of my profiles:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/dekarrin/">GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-nelson-973a64144/">LinkedIn</a></li>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			Being a software engineer who is also into open source development, I've
			got my hands in quite a few different places. Pretty much everything
			important and related to coding is up on my GitHub page, but I want to
			bring up a couple of highlights here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The biggest thing I've been involved with recently is a startup non-profit
			company called <a href="http://www.moeserifu.moe">Moe Serifu Circle</a>,
			which is working on creating a brand new anime-themed personal assistant. We
			want to promote and advance the science and research of personal assistant
			computing technology in order to help create a sustainably free ecosystem
			that improves all aspects of personal life. We may also accidentally end
			up invoking the singularity if all goes as planned, but, well, at least it
			will be cute and anime-themed!
		</p>
		<p>
			I've also created a domain-specific programming language for creating
			visual novels, called
			<a href="https://github.com/dekarrin/fairyscript">FairyScript</a>, designed
			for use with the Ren'Py scripting engine. The motivation behind it was to
			create a language that would cross-compile not only into an	executable VN
			with Ren'Py, but also into user-friendly Microsoft Word documents that can
			be shared with copy editors and preview readers.
		</p>
		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
			Nothing too fancy here! I'm a transgender girl from Minnesota who's into
			anime, software development, and possibly bringing about the singularity
			as we know it! I typically find myself involved with anime community
			initiatives, and a lot of time outside of my work is spent with that
			community; I'm always willing to take a night to hang out and watch some
			shows with fellow enthusiasts!
		</p>
		<p>
			I graduated from North Dakota State University, class of 2017. While I was
			there, I served in leadership positions in the student chapter of the
			<a href="http://ndacm.org">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, and in
			my last year I rebooted the previously disbanded Anime Club. It went on
			for at least one more year that I know of, and I was so proud to see it
			take on a life of its own! I was also involved in a small amount of LGBT
			advocacy during my time in school.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, I'm working hard to build up the anime community in Minnesota; I've
			kicked off a meetup group, and often find myself attending existing ones
			as well. I'm also working with my startup non-profit,
			<a href="http://www.moeserifu.moe">Moe Serifu Circle</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes to anime, I'm such a sucker for slice-of-life comedies,
			especially those with cute girls doing cute things. Lucky Star is one of
			favorite anime of all time, and Konata is a contender for best girl in my
			mind! Azumanga Daioh and Strawberry Marshmallow are pretty great as well,
			although I have to say that I think Nichijou blows them out of the water.
			Yay for absurdist comedy! I do tend to like some of the mystery / drama
			shows as well; for that genre, I'd have to say that Future Diary would be
			my favorite.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have expertise in a variety of programming languages, including C, C++,
			C#, Java, Python, and a little bit of ActionScript. My heart is mainly in
			development, but I've also got some experience with the infrastructure and
			operations side of things, particularly with regards to databases. My
			professional enterprise experience includes CassandraDB, Neo4J, and a
			little bit of MongoDB usage and administration.
